# 1.Introduction to the Course 
    # Deep Learning help computers to behave and understand like human, it is the subfield of Artificial Intelligence.
    # Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, which is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.
    # In this course I will be tested through self-assessment quizzes, code challenges and practical assignments.
    # Not only this, I will be making many projects with the guidance of Instructors at Internshala.

    # Neural networks are building blocks of Deep Learning models
    # Neural networks are inspired by the human brain, which is made up of billions of neurons.


# 2. Basics of Statistics
    # Types of Data - Qualitative and Quantitive 
    # Qualitative data is categorical data, which is further divided into two types - Nominal and Ordinal
    # Examples: Gender (Male/Female), Color(Red/Green)
    # Nominal refers to unordered values. Example: Gender, Nationality etc
    # Ordinal refers to ordered values or ranked values. Example: Rating like not satisfied, satisfied, highly satsified etc
    # Quantitive data is numerical data, which is further divided into two types - Discrete and Continuous.
    # Examples: Age, Height, Weight etc
    # Discrete data is countable data. Example: Number of students in a class, Number of cars in a parking lot etc
    # Continuous data is measurable data. Example: Height, Weight etc
