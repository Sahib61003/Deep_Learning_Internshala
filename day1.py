# 1.Introduction to the Course 
    # Deep Learning help computers to behave and understand like human, it is the subfield of Artificial Intelligence.
    # Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, which is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.
    # In this course I will be tested through self-assessment quizzes, code challenges and practical assignments.
    # Not only this, I will be making many projects with the guidance of Instructors at Internshala.

    # Neural networks are building blocks of Deep Learning models
    # Neural networks are inspired by the human brain, which is made up of billions of neurons.


# 2. Basics of Statistics
    # 2.1 Types of Data - Qualitative and Quantitive 
        # Qualitative data is categorical data, which is further divided into two types - Nominal and Ordinal
        # Examples: Gender (Male/Female), Color(Red/Green)
        # Nominal refers to unordered values. Example: Gender, Nationality etc
        # Ordinal refers to ordered values or ranked values. Example: Rating like not satisfied, satisfied, highly satsified etc
        # Quantitive data is numerical data i.e can be measured numerically, which is further divided into two types - Discrete and Continuous.
        # Examples: Age, Height, Weight etc
        # Discrete data is countable data. Example: Number of students in a class, Number of cars in a parking lot etc
        # Continuous data is measurable data. Example: Height, Weight etc
    # 2.2 Types of Statistics - Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics
        # Descriptive Stats consists of methods of organizing and describing data  using tables, graphs etc
        # Measures of Central Tendency -  Mean, Mode, Median
        # Measures of Dispersion - Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
        #Inferential Stats consists of methods that use sample results to help make decisions or predictions. LR, Decision Tree, Neural Networks are its examples or tools.
    # 2.3 Describig data graphically 
        # Histograms, Box Plots, Scatter Plots, Bar Graphs, Pie Charts etc
        # Frequency Distribution for qualitative data lists all categories and no. of elements that belong to each of the categories.
        # Frequency Distribution for quantative data lists all classes and number of values that belong to each class. Here we have grouped data.
        # Symmetric graph - data is represented in perfect normal curve.
        # Skewed graph - 
            # Positively skewed graph - data is concentrated on the left side of the graph.
            # Negatively skewed graph - data is concentrated on the right side of the graph.
    # Mesures  of Central Tendency
        # Mean - Average of all values; Mean = Sum of all values / Number of values
        # Median - Middle value of all values =
